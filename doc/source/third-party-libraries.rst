Third Party Libraries
======================================

This tutorial provides information on the various third party libraries used by NTRT.

JSONcpp
---------------
JSON is an acronym of JavaScript Object Notation, and is a standard interface for
serialization/de-serialization (getting data in and out of files). Information on JSON
can be found at http://json.org/

NTRT depends on JSONcpp. While it is installed by default by setup.sh, users who
are interested in JSONcpp's API can find it here: http://open-source-parsers.github.io/jsoncpp-docs/doxygen/index.html

Examples of JSON's use within NTRT can be found in examples/3_prism_serialize
More fully featured examples (using JSON's arrays, etc) can be found in dev/btietz/JSONTests

Neural Net
---------------------
